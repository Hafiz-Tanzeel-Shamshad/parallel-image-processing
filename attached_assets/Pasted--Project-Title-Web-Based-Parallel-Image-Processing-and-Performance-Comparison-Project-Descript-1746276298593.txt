üß† Project Title: Web-Based Parallel Image Processing and Performance Comparison
üìò Project Description
This project involves creating a web-based application that allows users to upload a single image or multiple images and apply image processing tasks (such as edge detection, blurring, and histogram equalization) using both sequential and parallel processing techniques. The app measures and compares execution time between these two approaches to highlight the advantages of parallel computing in image processing tasks.

üéØ Key Objectives
Develop a web interface for image upload and processing.

Implement sequential and parallel versions of image processing functions.

Allow users to compare performance metrics (time taken, speedup ratio).

Provide processed images for download or preview.

Demonstrate real-world utility of parallel computing in a user-friendly environment.

üß™ Core Image Processing Tasks
Edge Detection ‚Äì Using Canny filter.

Blurring ‚Äì Using Gaussian blur.

Histogram Equalization ‚Äì Enhancing contrast.

‚öôÔ∏è Parallel Processing Techniques
Technique	Description
Multiprocessing	CPU-based parallelism using multiple processes.
Threading	Lightweight threads, limited by GIL in CPU-bound tasks.
Joblib	High-level parallel loops for array-based tasks.
Concurrent Futures	Asynchronous task execution with process/thread pools.
CUDA (CuPy/Numba)	GPU-based acceleration (for advanced usage).
MPI (mpi4py)	Distributed computing for cluster-scale workloads.

üß∞ Python Libraries Used

‚úÖ Step 1: Set Up Environment
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask opencv-python numpy joblib matplotlib
‚úÖ Step 2: Create Flask Web Interface
HTML form to upload image(s)

Option to choose between Sequential or Parallel processing

Submit button triggers backend processing

html
Copy
Edit
<form action="/process" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="images" multiple>
    <select name="mode">
        <option value="sequential">Sequential</option>
        <option value="parallel">Parallel</option>
    </select>
    <button type="submit">Upload and Process</button>
</form>
‚úÖ Step 3: Backend - Define Image Processing Functions
python
Copy

import cv2

def process_image(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, 0)

    edges = cv2.Canny(img, 100, 200)
    blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5, 5), 0)
    hist_eq = cv2.equalizeHist(img)

    return {'original': img, 'edges': edges, 'blurred': blurred, 'hist_eq': hist_eq}
‚úÖ Step 4: Sequential and Parallel Processing Logic

import time
from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count

def sequential(images):
    start = time.time()
    results = [process_image(img) for img in images]
    end = time.time()
    return results, end - start

def parallel(images):
    start = time.time()
    with Pool(cpu_count()) as pool:
        results = pool.map(process_image, images)
    end = time.time()
    return results, end - start
‚úÖ Step 5: Backend Endpoint in Flask
python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, send_from_directory
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/process', methods=['POST'])
def process():
    mode = request.form['mode']
    files = request.files.getlist('images')
    paths = []

    for file in files:
        path = os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, file.filename)
        file.save(path)
        paths.append(path)

    if mode == 'sequential':
        results, duration = sequential(paths)
    else:
        results, duration = parallel(paths)

    return f"Mode: {mode}, Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"
‚úÖ Step 6: Compare and Display Results

Edit
speedup = seq_time / par_time
print(f"Speedup: {speedup:.2f}x")
üßæ Expected Output
Processed images saved/displayed.

Performance comparison printed or visualized.

Option to download results.

User can clearly see time reduction and speedup factor.

Fully functional web-based user interface makes the project user-friendly and practical.
