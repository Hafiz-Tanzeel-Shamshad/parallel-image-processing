Parallel Image Processing Web Application
A Comparative Analysis of Sequential vs. Parallel Computing Approaches

üìå Project Overview
This web application demonstrates the performance benefits of parallel computing for image processing tasks. Users can upload images and compare processing times between sequential and parallel implementations across multiple techniques (CPU multiprocessing, threading, GPU acceleration). The system provides real-time metrics, visual comparisons, and downloadable results.

Time Measurement

python
start = time.perf_counter()  # High-resolution timer
# Processing...
elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start
Speedup Calculation

Speedup = Sequential Time / Parallel Time
Efficiency Analysis

Efficiency = Speedup / Number of Cores
